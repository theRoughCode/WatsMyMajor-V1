# WatsMyMajor
Many students at the University of Waterloo intend on graduating with a more than one major.  It could be a double or triple major,
one major and two minors, or any combination.  However, the planning process to ensure you have the necessary courses is gruelling
and there is no good solution other than referencing the UWaterloo course requirements and using a spreadsheet to plan it out.  This
was exactly what I did, and it took way longer than it should have and cross referencing sites leaves much room for error.  This is 
highly undesirable because if I missed out on a course, I may have to stay back an extra term just to get that credit which would
cost both time and money (a term's worth of tuition, rent, the opportunity cost of not getting paid a full-time salary upon graduation, etc).
When I realized that what I was doing with the spreadsheet could largely be automated by a program, I decided to create this web app!<br />

WatsMyMajor is a web app designed for University of Waterloo students to search for courses by course code and displays information 
pertaining to the course.  The end goal of this web app is to allow students to plan out their whole 4-5 years at UWaterloo and ensure 
that they will have the necessary courses they need to graduate.
